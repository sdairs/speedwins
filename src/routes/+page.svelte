	<p>When you're building a new product, Speed Wins.</p>
	<p>
		It's easy to get stuck deciding which tools to use, and making bad choices that slow you down.
		These recomendations will let you start, and stay, fast.

		<div slot="details">
			<p>
				When you're building a product, there's a bunch of decisions you're going to need to make.
				Some of those decisions will be unique to the product you are building, but many won't.
				There's a lot of tools out there and it can be hard to know which are the right ones...or,
				at least, which are the <i>wrong</i> ones.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a startup, the most important thing is moving fast. You need to build, release, and
				iterate fast. If you don't, you will (probably) lose.
			</p>
			<p>The tools recommended on this site follow these principals:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Keep it simple:</b> you've got enough to worry about already, don't make your life harder
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>New isn't always better:</b> many established tools are popular for a reason, but...
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Sometimes new IS better:</b> don't ignore tools that genuinely change the game
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Build on strong foundations:</b> migrations are a huge time sink and will stop you from
					shipping, but...
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Don't chase perfection:</b> you'll never avoid migrations completely, so don't become paralysed
					by choice.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Yep, some of those are contradictory. That's life.</p>
			<p>
				The point of this site is to skip the analysis-paralysis. None of these tools are perfect,
				but none of them are <i>wrong</i>.
