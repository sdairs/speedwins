When you're building a new product, Speed Wins.

It's easy to get stuck deciding which tools to use, and making bad choices that slow you down.

These recomendations will let you start, and stay, fast.

When you're building a product, there's a bunch of decisions you're going to need to make. Some of those decisions will be unique to the product you are building, but many won't. There's a lot of tools out there and it can be hard to know which are the right ones...or, at least, which are the *wrong* ones.

For a startup, the most important thing is moving fast. You need to build, release, and iterate fast. If you don't, you will (probably) lose.

The tools recommended on this site follow these principals:

- **Keep it simple:** you've got enough to worry about already, don't make your life harder
- **New isn't always better:** many established tools are popular for a reason, but...
- **Sometimes new IS better:** don't ignore tools that genuinely change the game
- **Build on strong foundations:** migrations are a huge time sink and will stop you from shipping, but...
- **Don't chase perfection:** you'll never avoid migrations completely, so don't become paralysed by choice.

Yep, some of those are contradictory. That's life

The point of this site is to skip the analysis-paralysis. None of these tools are perfect, but none of them are *wrong*.
